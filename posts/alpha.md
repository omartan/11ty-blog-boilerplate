Scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet yet floof tum, tickle bum, jellybean footies curly toes and lick yarn. 

Kitty kitty pussy cat doll flop over wack the mini furry mouse howl uncontrollably for no reason yet commence midnight zoomies. Refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am hide at bottom of staircase to trip.
